Improving Model Performance: Model-Centric and Data-Centric Approaches
This document outlines strategies for improving the performance of machine learning models, categorized into model-centric and data-centric approaches. By following these methods, the aim is to achieve a more robust, accurate, and generalizable model.

1. Model-Centric Approach
Improving the model's performance by focusing on its architecture, training, and hyperparameters.

From a model-centric perspective, the most direct way to improve training outcomes is to use more advanced and better-performing models, although this typically entails greater resource and time consumption. In this project, we utilized the `unsloth/Llama-3.2-1B-bnb-4bit` model to achieve faster training times. If resources and time allow, it can be replaced with models such as `unsloth/Llama-3.2-3B-bnb-4bit`. For a specific model, the following methods can be used to enhance performance:

1. Hyperparameter Tuning: This includes methods such as Grid Search, Random Search, and Bayesian Optimization.  
2. Regularization Techniques: Add dropout layers to prevent overfitting or apply L2 regularization to weight parameters.  
3. **Optimization Techniques: Experiment with optimizers and learning rate schedules to improve convergence.  
4. Adjust Loss Function: Tailor the loss function to better suit the task requirements.

2. Data-Centric Approach
Improving model performance by focusing on the quality and quantity of the training dataset.

From a data-centric perspective, the following methods should be adopted to enhance model performance:

1. Increase the Data Quantity: Expand the training dataset.  
2. Improve Data Quality: Preprocess the training data to remove duplicates, noisy, or irrelevant data, and use more accurate classifications.
